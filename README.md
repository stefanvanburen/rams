# rams

A colorscheme for neovim (and maybe, eventually, more?).

For now, the colors have been migrated from [rams.vim](https://github.com/stefanvanburen/rams.vim),
which used [vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate),
to this repository, 
which is using [lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).
